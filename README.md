Exploratory data analysis for public stock data
![stocks](img.jpg | width=300)
This project explores the price behavior, trends, volatility, and moving average of four popular publicly-traded stocks in comparison with the overall market. Stock prices can be considered an example of time series data, which is data dependent on the time of each observation. Traders conduct buying and selling strategies by analyzing various metrics. This first notebook gives an overview of several stocks using exploratory data analysis, several performance metrics, and moving average. The second notebook to follow will focus more on prediction of future prices using regression and machine learning.
